  Imagine the greatest dinner party ever had - and you are the host! On your
  left is Ben Franklin on your right is Julius Caesar - in front of you is Mary
  Shelly the author of Frankenstein and sitting next to her is Elizabeth the
  1st. Other notables at the table include Buddha, Genghis Khan and John Lennon.
  At the end of the table is Teddy Roosevelt and at the other end is Julius
  Caesar. Did I forget anyone? Of course I did what if you could also include
  passed away family members or other famous people of personal importance to
  you? At this dinner party you decide the guests and you only need to cook for
  yourself and any other flesh and blood dinner guests. How is it possible?
  Thank's to Microsoft's Hololens we can now create "augmented reality"
  environments. You will still be able to see and converse with your friends
  while "seeing - and communicating" with your other guests. Is this project of
  interest to you? We will be creating a kickstarter for "Aianyone" in the very
  near future and subscribers will get access to the version 1.0 which will
  include 10 world famous celebrity AI's to interact with. As a founding member
  you will also be granted a 90% perpetual discount to our subscription services
  as long as you keep your account active! Individuals with money to spare can
  also contract to have a specific AI made. This is done by combining all
  letters, books, video and photos that you can gather and any favorite books
  the person was or is known for liking. With this information we can create a
  1.0 AI. Remember this technology is still in its infancy but as it gets more
  sophisticated so will your AI! We will not charge extra to upgrade an AI you
  purchased.
