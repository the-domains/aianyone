            <description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine the greatest dinner party ever had - and you are the host! On your left is Ben Franklin on your right is Julius Caesar - in front of you is Mary Shelly the author of Frankenstein and sitting next to her is Elizabeth the 1st. Other notables at the table include Buddha, Genghis Khan and John Lennon. At the end of the table is Teddy Roosevelt and at the other end is Julius Caesar. Did I forget anyone? Of course I did what if you could also include passed away family members or other famous people of personal importance to you? At this dinner party you decide the guests and you only need to cook for yourself and any other flesh and blood dinner guests. How is it possible? Thank's to Microsoft's Hololens we can now create "augmented reality" environments. You will still be able to see and converse with your friends while "seeing - and communicating" with your other guests. Is this project of interest to you? We will be creating a kickstarter for "Aianyone" in the very near future and subscribers will get access to the version 1.0 which will include 10 world famous celebrity AI's to interact with. As a founding member you will also be granted a 90% perpetual discount to our subscription services as long as you keep your account active! Individuals with money to spare can also contract to have a specific AI made. This is done by combining all letters, books, video and photos that you can gather and any favorite books the person was or is known for liking. With this information we can create a 1.0 AI. Remember this technology is still in its infancy but as it gets more sophisticated so will your AI! We will not charge extra to upgrade an AI you purchased.</p>]]></description>
